# VR Dungeon Generator
For my final year project / dissertation I decided to investigate procedural level generation, to do this I built a dungeon generator in the Unity Engine that can be explored in virtual reality. This project was completed over the 8 months of my final year, the work was done independently of my lectures and computer lab practicals.
