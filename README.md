# VR Dungeon Generator
For my final year project / dissertation I decided to investigate procedural level generation, to do this I built a dungeon generator in the Unity Engine that can be explored in virtual reality. The dungeon generator works by connecting randomly selected pre-defined rooms, these rooms can be designed using the tools I also made for the project.
