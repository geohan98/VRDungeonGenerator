# VR Dungeon Generator
For my final year project / dissertation I decided to investigate procedural level generation, to do this I built a dungeon generator in the Unity Engine that can be explored in virtual reality. This project was completed over the 8 months of my final year, the work was done independent of my lectures and computer lab practicalâ€™s, I did have to update my project supervisor on the progress of the project during 10 meetings that would happen over the project.
